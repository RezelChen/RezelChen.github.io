<li><p>They can be much more compact than the various “binary JSON” variants, since they can omit field names from the encoded data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The schema is a valuable form of documentation, and because the schema is required for decoding, you can be sure that it is up to date (whereas manually maintained documentation may easily diverge from reality).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keeping a database of schemas allows you to check forward and backward com‐ patibility of schema changes, before anything is deployed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For users of statically typed programming languages, the ability to generate code from the schema is useful, since it enables type checking at compile time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, schema evolution allows the same kind of flexibility as schemaless/schema-on-read JSON databases provide, while also providing better guarantees about your data and better tooling.</p>
<h3 id="Modes-of-Dataflow"><a href="#Modes-of-Dataflow" class="headerlink" title="Modes of Dataflow"></a>Modes of Dataflow</h3><h4 id="Dataflow-Through-Databases"><a href="#Dataflow-Through-Databases" class="headerlink" title="Dataflow Through Databases"></a>Dataflow Through Databases</h4><h5 id="Different-values-written-at-different-times"><a href="#Different-values-written-at-different-times" class="headerlink" title="Different values written at different times"></a>Different values written at different times</h5><p>Schema evolution thus allows the entire database to appear as if it was encoded with a single schema, even though the underlying storage may contain records encoded with various historical versions of the schema.</p>

A network request is very different from a local function call:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A local function call is predictable and either succeeds or fails, depending only on parameters that are under your control. A network request is unpredictable: the request or response may be lost due to a network problem, or the remote machine may be slow or unavailable, and such problems are entirely outside of your control. </p>
</li>
<li><p>A network request has another possible outcome: it may return without a result, due to a timeout. </p>
</li>
<li><p>If you retry a failed network request, it could happen that the requests are actually getting through, and only the responses are getting lost. In that case, retrying will cause the action to be performed multiple times, unless you build a mechanism for deduplication (idempotence) into the protocol.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A network request is much slower than a function call, and its latency is also wildly variable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you call a local function, you can efficiently pass it references (pointers) to objects in local memory. When you make a network request, all those parameters need to be encoded into a sequence of bytes that can be sent over the network.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The client and the service may be implemented in different programming lan‐ guages, so the RPC framework must translate datatypes from one language into another.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Current-directions-for-RPC"><a href="#Current-directions-for-RPC" class="headerlink" title="Current directions for RPC"></a>Current directions for RPC</h5><p>The main focus of RPC frameworks is on requests between services owned by the same organization, typically within the same datacenter.</p>
<h5 id="Data-encoding-and-evolution-for-RPC"><a href="#Data-encoding-and-evolution-for-RPC" class="headerlink" title="Data encoding and evolution for RPC"></a>Data encoding and evolution for RPC</h5><p>We can make a simplifying assumption in the case of dataflow through services: it is reasonable to assume that all the servers will be updated first, and all the clients second. Thus, you only need backward compatibility on requests, and forward compatibility on responses.</p>
<p>If a compatibility-breaking change is required, the service provider often ends up maintaining multiple versions of the service API side by side.</p>
<h4 id="Message-Passing-Dataflow"><a href="#Message-Passing-Dataflow" class="headerlink" title="Message-Passing Dataflow"></a>Message-Passing Dataflow</h4><p>Using a message broker has several advantages compared to direct RPC:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It can act as a buffer if the recipient is unavailable or overloaded, and thus improve system reliability.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It can automatically redeliver messages to a process that has crashed, and thus prevent messages from being lost.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It avoids the sender needing to know the IP address and port number of the recipient.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It allows one message to be sent to several recipients.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It logically decouples the sender from the recipient.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, a difference compared to RPC is that message-passing communication is usually one-way: a sender normally doesn’t expect to receive a reply to its messages. </p>
<h5 id="Message-brokers"><a href="#Message-brokers" class="headerlink" title="Message brokers"></a>Message brokers</h5><h5 id="Distributed-actor-frameworks"><a href="#Distributed-actor-frameworks" class="headerlink" title="Distributed actor frameworks"></a>Distributed actor frameworks</h5><p>The <em>actor model</em> is a programming model for concurrency in a single process. Each actor typically represents one client or entity, it may have some local state, and it communicates with other actors by sending and receiving asynchronous messages. Message delivery is not guaranteed: in certain error scenarios, mes‐ sages will be lost. Since each actor processes only one message at a time, it doesn’t need to worry about threads, and each actor can be scheduled independently by the framework.</p>
<p>In <em>distributed actor frameworks</em>, this programming model is used to scale an applica‐ tion across multiple nodes. The same message-passing mechanism is used, no matter whether the sender and recipient are on the same node or different nodes. </p>

          <h2 id="Storage-and-Retrieval"><a href="#Storage-and-Retrieval" class="headerlink" title="Storage and Retrieval"></a>Storage and Retrieval</h2><p>We will examine two families of storage engines: <em>log-structured</em> storage engines, and <em>page-oriented</em> storage engines such as B-trees.</p>
<h3 id="Data-Structures-That-Power-Your-Database"><a href="#Data-Structures-That-Power-Your-Database" class="headerlink" title="Data Structures That Power Your Database"></a>Data Structures That Power Your Database</h3><h4 id="Hash-Indexes"><a href="#Hash-Indexes" class="headerlink" title="Hash Indexes"></a>Hash Indexes</h4><p>Segments are never modified after they have been written, so the merged segment is written to a new file. The merging and compaction of frozen segments can be done in a background thread, and while it is going on, we can still continue to serve read and write requests as normal, using the old segment files. After the merging process is complete, we switch read requests to using the new merged segment instead of the old segments — and then the old segment files can simply be deleted.</p>
<p>Each segment now has its own in-memory hash table, mapping keys to file offsets. </p>
<p>An append-only design turns out to be good for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Appending and segment merging are sequential write operations, which are generally much faster than random writes, especially on magnetic spinning-disk hard drives.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Concurrency and crash recovery are much simpler if segment files are append-only or immutable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Merging old segments avoids the problem of data files getting fragmented over time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The hash table index also has limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The hash table must fit in memory, so if you have a very large number of keys, you’re out of luck.</li>
<li>Range queries are not efficient. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="SSTables-and-LSM-Trees"><a href="#SSTables-and-LSM-Trees" class="headerlink" title="SSTables and LSM-Trees"></a>SSTables and LSM-Trees</h4><p>SSTables have several big advantages over log segments with hash indexes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Merging segments is simple and efficient, even if the files are bigger than the available memory. The approach is like the one used in the <em>mergesort</em> algorithm</p>
</li>
<li><p>In order to find a particular key in the file, you no longer need to keep an index of all the keys in memory. You still need an in-memory index to tell you the offsets for some of the keys, but it can be sparse: one key for every few kilobytes of segment file is sufficient, because a few kilobytes can be scanned very quickly.i</p>
</li>
<li><p>Since read requests need to scan over several key-value pairs in the requested range anyway, it is possible to group those records into a block and compress it before writing it to disk. Each entry of the sparse in-memory index then points at the start of a compressed block.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Constructing-and-maintaining-SSTables"><a href="#Constructing-and-maintaining-SSTables" class="headerlink" title="Constructing and maintaining SSTables"></a>Constructing and maintaining SSTables</h5><ul>
<li><p>When a write comes in, add it to an in-memory balanced tree data structure (for<br>example, a red-black tree). This in-memory tree is sometimes called a memtable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When the memtable gets bigger than some threshold—typically a few megabytes—write it out to disk as an SSTable file. This can be done efficiently because the tree already maintains the key-value pairs sorted by key. The new SSTable file becomes the most recent segment of the database. While the SSTable is being written out to disk, writes can continue to a new memtable instance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In order to serve a read request, first try to find the key in the memtable, then in the most recent on-disk segment, then in the next-older segment, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From time to time, run a merging and compaction process in the background to combine segment files and to discard overwritten or deleted values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This scheme works very well. It only suffers from one problem: if the database crashes, the most recent writes (which are in the memtable but not yet written out to disk) are lost. In order to avoid that problem, we can keep a separate log on disk to which every write is immediately appended, just like in the previous section. That log is not in sorted order, but that doesn’t matter, because its only purpose is to restore the memtable after a crash. Every time the memtable is written out to an SSTable, the corresponding log can be discarded.</p>
<h5 id="Making-an-LSM-tree-out-of-SSTables"><a href="#Making-an-LSM-tree-out-of-SSTables" class="headerlink" title="Making an LSM-tree out of SSTables"></a>Making an LSM-tree out of SSTables</h5><h5 id="Performance-optimizations"><a href="#Performance-optimizations" class="headerlink" title="Performance optimizations"></a>Performance optimizations</h5><p>The LSM-tree algorithm can be slow when looking up keys that do not exist in the database. In order to optimize this kind of access, storage engines often use additional <em>Bloom filters</em>.</p>
<p>There are also different strategies to determine the order and timing of how SSTables are compacted and merged. The most common options are <em>size-tiered</em> and <em>leveled</em> compaction.</p>
<h4 id="B-Trees"><a href="#B-Trees" class="headerlink" title="B-Trees"></a>B-Trees</h4><p>Like SSTables, B-trees keep key-value pairs sorted by key, which allows efficient key- value lookups and range queries.</p>
<p>B-trees break the database down into fixed-size blocks or pages, traditionally 4 KB in size (sometimes bigger), and read or write one page at a time. </p>
<p>Each page can be identified using an address or location, which allows one page to refer to another—similar to a pointer, but on disk instead of in memory. </p>
<h5 id="Making-B-trees-reliable"><a href="#Making-B-trees-reliable" class="headerlink" title="Making B-trees reliable"></a>Making B-trees reliable</h5><p>In order to make the database resilient to crashes, it is common for B-tree implemen‐ tations to include an additional data structure on disk: a write-ahead log (WAL, also known as a redo log). </p>
<p>An additional complication of updating pages in place is that careful concurrency control is required if multiple threads are going to access the B-tree at the same time —otherwise a thread may see the tree in an inconsistent state. This is typically done by protecting the tree’s data structures with <em>latches</em> (lightweight locks).</p>
<h5 id="B-tree-optimizations"><a href="#B-tree-optimizations" class="headerlink" title="B-tree optimizations"></a>B-tree optimizations</h5><ul>
<li><p>Instead of overwriting pages and maintaining a WAL for crash recovery, some databases (like LMDB) use a copy-on-write scheme. A modified page is written to a different location, and a new version of the parent pages in the tree is created, pointing at the new location. </p>
</li>
<li><p>We can save space in pages by not storing the entire key, but abbreviating it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If a query needs to scan over a large part of the key range in sorted order, that page-by-page layout can be ineffi‐ cient, because a disk seek may be required for every page that is read. Many B- tree implementations therefore try to lay out the tree so that leaf pages appear in sequential order on disk. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Additional pointers have been added to the tree. For example, each leaf page may have references to its sibling pages to the left and right, which allows scanning keys in order without jumping back to parent pages.</p>
</li>
<li><p>B-tree variants such as fractal trees borrow some log-structured ideas to reduce disk seeks (and they have nothing to do with fractals).</p>
</li>

<p>LSM-trees can be compressed better, and thus often produce smaller files on disk than B-trees. </p>
<h5 id="Downsides-of-LSM-trees"><a href="#Downsides-of-LSM-trees" class="headerlink" title="Downsides of LSM-trees"></a>Downsides of LSM-trees</h5><p>A downside of log-structured storage is that the compaction process can sometimes interfere with the performance of ongoing reads and writes. </p>
<p>Another issue with compaction arises at high write throughput: the disk’s finite write bandwidth needs to be shared between the initial write (logging and flushing a memtable to disk) and the compaction threads running in the background.</p>
<p>If write throughput is high and compaction is not configured carefully, it can happen that compaction cannot keep up with the rate of incoming writes.</p>
<p>An advantage of B-trees is that each key exists in exactly one place in the index, whereas a log-structured storage engine may have multiple copies of the same key in different segments. This aspect makes B-trees attractive in databases that want to offer strong transactional semantics: in many relational databases, transaction isola‐ tion is implemented using locks on ranges of keys, and in a B-tree index, those locks can be directly attached to the tree </p>

<h3 id="Query-Languages-for-Data"><a href="#Query-Languages-for-Data" class="headerlink" title="Query Languages for Data"></a>Query Languages for Data</h3><p>A declarative query language is attractive because it is typically more concise and eas‐ ier to work with than an imperative API. But more importantly, it also hides imple‐ mentation details of the database engine, which makes it possible for the database system to introduce performance improvements without requiring any changes to queries.</p>

Higher-level query languages like SQL can be implemented as a pipeline of MapReduce operations but there are also many dis‐ tributed implementations of SQL that don’t use MapReduce.</p>
<p>Note there is nothing in SQL that constrains it to running on a single machine, and MapReduce doesn’t have a monopoly on distributed query execution.</p>
<h3 id="Graph-Like-Data-Models"><a href="#Graph-Like-Data-Models" class="headerlink" title="Graph-Like Data Models"></a>Graph-Like Data Models</h3><p>In the examples just given, all the vertices in a graph represent the same kind of thing (people, web pages, or road junctions, respectively). However, graphs are not limited to such homogeneous data: an equally powerful use of graphs is to provide a consis‐ tent way of storing completely different types of objects in a single datastore.</p>

<ul>
<li>A unique identifier</li>

<li>A label to describe the kind of relationship between the two vertices</li>

<li>The application performs the function that the user expected.</li>
<li>It can tolerate the user making mistakes or using the software in unexpected ways.</li>
<li>Its performance is good enough for the required use case, under the expected load and data volume.</li>
<li>The system prevents any unauthorized access and abuse.</li>

The best choice of parameters depends on the architecture of your system: it may be requests per second to a web server, the ratio of reads to writes in a database, the number of simultaneously active users in a chat room, the hit rate on a cache, or something else. Perhaps the average case is what matters for you, or perhaps your bottleneck is dominated by a small number of extreme cases.</p>
<h4 id="Describing-Performance"><a href="#Describing-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Describing Performance"></a>Describing Performance</h4><ul>
<li>throughput — the number of records we can process per second</li>
<li>the total time it takes to run a job on a dataset of a certain size</li>
<li>response time — the time between a client sending a request and receiving a response</li>
<li>latency is the duration that a request is waiting to be handled—during which it is <em>latent</em>, awaiting service</li>
</ul>
<p>High percentiles of response times, also known as <em>tail latencies</em>, are important because they directly affect users’ experience of the service.</p>
<h4 id="Approaches-for-Coping-with-Load"><a href="#Approaches-for-Coping-with-Load" class="headerlink" title="Approaches for Coping with Load"></a>Approaches for Coping with Load</h4><p>While distributing stateless services across multiple machines is fairly straightfor‐ ward, taking stateful data systems from a single node to a distributed setup can intro‐ duce a lot of additional complexity.</p>
<p>An architecture that scales well for a particular application is built around assumptions of which operations will be common and which will be rare — the load parameters.</p>
<p>Even though they are specific to a particular application, scalable architectures are nevertheless usually built from general-purpose building blocks, arranged in familiar patterns.</p>
